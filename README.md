Secret Santa is a fun way to exchange gifts. Sign up and enter a wish list of items that you would like to receive as gifts. The Magical Christmas Cheer Processor will then randomly assign gift givers (Santas) and receivers. When you sign in again, you’ll see who you have been assigned to play Santa for, and what items are on his or her wish list. Someone else, another Santa, will have been assigned your name and wish list and will be shopping as well! You can either hand-craft your gifts in your workshop at the North Pole, or, if you don’t have one of those, you can follow our convenient link to Amazon to simplify things. When gift-giving day arrives, follow the Secret Santa Map to the party! Gifts will be exchanged, and secret Santas revealed! Have fun, and spread Christmas Cheer!
